            Why is Bacolod called the City of Smile?
        </h3>
        <p>It is known as the City of Smiles because of its MassKara Festival, a Mardi Gras-like.</p>
        <p>festival and a spectacularly vivid mix of dance, color and music. Bacolod is also known.</p>
        <p>as the Land of Sweet People, and for its culinary heritage, including its inasal (a kind of</p>
        <p>roast chicken on skewers) and sweet dessert treats.</p>

        <h3>Why is MassKara Festival known as the City of smile?</h3>

        <p>This annual festival, which is similar to Brazil's Rio</p>
        <p>Carnival, literally translates to “many faces,” and is</p>
        <p>celebrated every October in Bacolod. Because of the</p>
        <p>smiling faces of the mask, Bacolod City got the</p>
        <p>nickname of The City of Smiles.</p>
