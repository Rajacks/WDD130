      <h3>City Of Smile festivals</h3>
      <p>
        Why is Bacolod called the City of Smile?

        It is known as the City of Smiles because of its MassKara Festival, a Mardi Gras-like
        festival and a spectacularly vivid mix of dance, color and music. Bacolod is also known
        as the Land of Sweet People, and for its culinary heritage, including its inasal (a kind of
        roast chicken on skewers) and sweet dessert treats.

        Why is MassKara Festival known as the City of smile?

        This annual festival, which is similar to Brazil's Rio
        Carnival, literally translates to “many faces,” and is
        celebrated every October in Bacolod. Because of the
        smiling faces of the mask, Bacolod City got the
        nickname of The City of Smiles.

        What is the famous delicacy in Bacolod?

        Cansi or Kansi is considered one of the signature
        dishes in Bacolod. It is an Ilonggo/Negrense dish that
        seems to be a combination of the top favorite and
        famous Filipino dishes, Bulalo and Sinigang. It is a
        boiled bone-in beef shank and usually comes with the bone marrow.

        Piaya is the famous delicacy of Negros to be more
        specific Bacolod City have the best piaya. Because
        Negros is known as major producer of sugar from
        its vast field of sugar cane. Negros made a delicacy
        to promote the sugar industry in Negros. 

        What is the history of Bacolod City?

        Bacolod was derived from the Ilonggo word “bakolod”
        meaning “stonehill” since the settlement was founded
        in 1770 on a stonehill area, now the district of
        Granada and the former site of the Bacolod Murcia
        Milling Company. Due to the Muslim raids in 1787,
        Bacolod was transferred towards the shoreline.
